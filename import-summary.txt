ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .gitignore
* market\
* market\icon\
* market\icon\icon.png
* market\icon\icon.svg
* market\screenshots\
* market\screenshots\new_account.png
* market\screenshots\new_account_7.png
* market\screenshots\synchro.png
* market\screenshots\synchro_7.png

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* libs\android-support-v4.jar => app\libs\android-support-v4.jar
* libs\backport-util-concurrent-3.1.jar => app\libs\backport-util-concurrent-3.1.jar
* libs\commons-codec-1.5.jar => app\libs\commons-codec-1.5.jar
* libs\commons-lang-2.6.jar => app\libs\commons-lang-2.6.jar
* libs\commons-logging-1.1.1.jar => app\libs\commons-logging-1.1.1.jar
* proguard-project.txt => app\proguard-project.txt
* res\ => app\src\main\res\
* src\ => app\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
